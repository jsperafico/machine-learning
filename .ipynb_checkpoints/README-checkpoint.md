# What I'm following?

Please consider that's my learning process on Machine Learning.
I'm enrolled at [Udemy' course](https://www.udemy.com/course/machine-learning-course-with-python).

## Requirements

I'm using docker container with [Jupyter and Conda](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/datascience-notebook/).
It's easier to install, already configured with almost everything that you may need.
